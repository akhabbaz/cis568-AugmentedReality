Here are some clues to how to get the cube orientation to be correct.
Start the device vertical when the phone. 

The transformation is correct as it stands.:


The first part getting the cube to rotate with the device works.  I was able to
transfer the mobile build to my kindle Fire and run it from the kindle.  That all
worked.  There is a movie of this in the directory.  

I worked on the paint ball too, but did not finish that.  If I point the camera on
the kindle at my computer screen the AR camera recognize this and the cross symbol
disappears.

I tried to finish this at home but my desktop no longer builds and deploys to the
kindle.  I spent hours at this in February and it worked.  I since had to reinstall
the operating system.  Now Android studio failed to build and deploy to the kindle
while at home.  The error is that Gradle can't find build tool 28.0.0 but that is
installed.  I will check again and try to finish this tomorrow.
